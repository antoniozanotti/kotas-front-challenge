## Suggestions for improvements to the provided design file

- Creation of variables for colors, font styles, dropshadown and border radius.
- Creation of a page with guidelines.
- Standardize margins, paddings, line heights and border-radius.
- Use the Tailwind CSS standard sizes and colors.
- Creation of skeletons.
- Creation of state with no results found.
- Better specification of the scroll or fixed bar visual element at the top, the expected behavior was not clear and that's why I didn't do it.

## Folder and file structure
- assets: for images and styles that will not available in the public folder.
  - css/main.css: style file that will be included in every application.
- components: stores the visual components.
  - common: components present on more than one page.
  - pages: specific components of each page.
  - ui: interface components that could be removed from this project to create a library of reusable components across projects. The styles of these components are only of their scope and not the project.
- composables: for api calls with tanstack.
- design: design files received.
- layouts: Nuxt's default folder that allows multiple layouts for application, but only one was used.
- pages: Nuxt route structure and component calls for each page.
- plugins: Nuxt default folder.
  - vue-query.ts: plugin for @tanstack/vue-query.
- public: contains assets that will be available via the route /.
- nuxt.config.ts: Nuxt configuration for libraries: @nuxtjs/google-fonts, @nuxt/image, tailwindcss. I also styled the background color of body here.
- tailwind.config.js: Tailwind CSS configuration file. Configured default fonts, boxShadow, and example of how color customization could be used.
